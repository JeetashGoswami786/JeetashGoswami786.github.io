                        <p>2025 was a year of such relentless momentum that I barely had a moment to look up, let alone share my progress here. But as 2026 begins, I realized that reflecting on how far we’ve come is the best way to fuel the ambition for what’s next. Looking back, 2025 was defined by the intersection of Power Systems, Deep Learning, Aerospace and manymore.............<b>

                        <h3>The Logic of Continuous Learning</h3>
                        <p>Technology is built on continuous learning. I created this space to share the logic, code, and lessons learned from my professional engineering experience.</p>
                        <p>Whether it is calculating the turns for a transformer or debugging a drone swarm in Mission Planner, the engineering mindset is about breaking complex chaos into manageable logic. This year, my focus is bridging the gap between raw hardware (Electrical) and intelligent software (AI).</p>

                        <p>Just completed the "Mastering Conversation Modeling with LLMs" workshop. It's fascinating how context protocols are shifting how we interact with AI agents. Planning to implement these concepts in my next project.</p>
